class BaseLandmarker(AbstractContextManager, ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for a generic landmarker.

    This class provides a standard interface for landmark detection
    classes, including context manager support for automatic resource
    management.

    Methods:
                                    close(): Release resources used by the landmarker.
                                    __enter__(): Enter the runtime context related to this object.
                                    __exit__(): Exit the runtime context and release resources.

    Usage with context manager:
                                    >>> with SomeLandmarkerImplementation(...) as detector:
                                    ...     detector.detect(frame)
                                    # Resources are automatically released when exiting the block.
    """

    @abstractmethod
    def close(self):
        """
        Close the landmarker and release all associated resources.

        Subclasses must implement this method to properly clean up
        resources such as model memory, threads, or GPU allocations.

        Raises:
                                        Any exception relevant to resource release failure.

        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
